Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to process sequential data by maintaining internal state or memory. Unlike feedforward networks that process inputs independently, RNNs have connections that form cycles, allowing information to persist across time steps. This architecture makes RNNs particularly suitable for tasks involving sequences, such as natural language processing, time series prediction, and speech recognition.

The fundamental mechanism of RNNs involves processing sequences one element at a time while maintaining a hidden state that captures information about previous elements. At each time step, the network receives an input and the previous hidden state, producing an output and updating the hidden state. This recurrent connection enables the network to maintain context and dependencies across the sequence. The same weights are shared across all time steps, allowing the network to generalize across sequences of varying lengths.

Traditional RNNs suffer from the vanishing and exploding gradient problems when processing long sequences. During backpropagation through time, gradients can become exponentially small or large as they propagate through many time steps, making it difficult to learn long-term dependencies. Vanishing gradients prevent the network from learning relationships between distant sequence elements, while exploding gradients cause training instability. These issues severely limit the practical application of basic RNNs to short sequences.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) were developed to address these limitations. LSTMs use a complex gating mechanism with input, forget, and output gates that regulate information flow, allowing the network to selectively remember or forget information over long sequences. GRUs simplify the LSTM architecture while maintaining similar capabilities. These architectures have been widely successful for machine translation, text generation, and other sequence modeling tasks. However, transformer-based models have recently outperformed RNNs in many applications due to their ability to process sequences in parallel and capture long-range dependencies more effectively through attention mechanisms.
