Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, which requires labeled examples, reinforcement learning learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions. This approach is particularly effective for sequential decision-making problems.

The reinforcement learning framework consists of several key components: an agent that takes actions, an environment that the agent interacts with, a state space representing possible situations, an action space defining available actions, and a reward signal that evaluates action quality. The agent's goal is to learn a policy, a mapping from states to actions, that maximizes cumulative reward over time.

Value-based methods like Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) estimate the expected cumulative reward for taking specific actions in given states. The Q-function represents the value of state-action pairs, and the agent selects actions that maximize these values. DQN combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces, enabling breakthrough performance in complex environments like Atari games.

Policy-based methods directly optimize the policy without explicitly computing value functions. Policy gradient algorithms like REINFORCE update policy parameters in directions that increase expected rewards. Actor-critic methods combine both approaches, using a critic to estimate value functions while an actor learns the policy. Advanced algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) have achieved remarkable success in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems, demonstrating the power of reinforcement learning in solving complex real-world problems.
