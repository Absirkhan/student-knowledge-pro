Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized in layers that process information in a hierarchical manner. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that adjusts during the learning process.

A typical neural network architecture includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives raw data, hidden layers perform intermediate computations and feature extraction, while the output layer produces the final prediction or classification. Deep neural networks, which contain multiple hidden layers, have revolutionized fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

The learning process in neural networks involves forward propagation and backpropagation. During forward propagation, input data flows through the network, and each neuron applies an activation function to its weighted sum of inputs. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). The ReLU function has become particularly popular due to its computational efficiency and ability to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting weights to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs. This optimization process relies on gradient descent, where the network iteratively updates weights in the direction that reduces the loss function. Various optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop enhance the training efficiency and convergence speed of neural networks.
