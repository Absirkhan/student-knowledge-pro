Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism is a technique that allows neural networks to focus on specific parts of input sequences when generating outputs. Originally developed to improve neural machine translation, attention has become a fundamental building block in modern deep learning architectures. The key insight is that not all input elements are equally important for producing each output, and the model should learn which parts to focus on.

In the context of sequence-to-sequence models, attention addresses the bottleneck of encoding entire input sequences into fixed-size context vectors. Instead, attention mechanisms compute a weighted sum of encoder hidden states for each decoder step, where weights represent the relevance of each input position to the current output. This allows the model to dynamically access different parts of the input as needed, significantly improving performance on long sequences.

The attention score between a query and a key is typically computed using a compatibility function, such as dot product or additive attention. These scores are normalized using a softmax function to produce attention weights, which are then used to compute a weighted average of value vectors. The resulting context vector combines information from relevant input positions and guides the generation of the current output.

Self-attention, or intra-attention, extends the attention concept by allowing sequence elements to attend to each other within the same sequence. This mechanism is the foundation of transformer architectures and enables models to capture complex relationships and dependencies within inputs. Scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention are specific implementations that have proven highly effective. The attention mechanism has also found applications beyond NLP, including computer vision tasks where it helps models focus on relevant image regions and time series analysis where it identifies important temporal patterns.
