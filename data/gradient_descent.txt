Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used to train machine learning models by iteratively adjusting parameters to minimize a loss function. The algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to model parameters and updates parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient, moving toward a local or global minimum. The learning rate, a hyperparameter controlling the step size, plays a crucial role in convergence speed and stability.

Three main variants of gradient descent differ in how they use training data for updates. Batch gradient descent computes gradients using the entire training dataset, providing accurate gradient estimates but requiring significant computational resources for large datasets. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates parameters after each training example, introducing noise but enabling faster iterations and better generalization. Mini-batch gradient descent strikes a balance by computing gradients on small batches of data, combining computational efficiency with reasonably stable updates.

The learning rate is critical to gradient descent's success. If too large, the algorithm may overshoot the minimum and diverge; if too small, convergence becomes extremely slow. Learning rate schedules address this by decreasing the learning rate during training, allowing aggressive initial exploration followed by fine-tuned convergence. Adaptive learning rate methods like momentum, which accumulates past gradients to smooth updates and accelerate convergence, have become standard.

Advanced optimization algorithms build upon basic gradient descent. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines momentum with adaptive learning rates for individual parameters, computing element-wise learning rates based on first and second moment estimates of gradients. RMSprop adapts learning rates using a moving average of squared gradients. These optimizers typically converge faster and more reliably than basic SGD. Understanding gradient descent and its variants is essential for effectively training deep learning models and diagnosing optimization problems like vanishing or exploding gradients.
